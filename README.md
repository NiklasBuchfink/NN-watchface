# MoveToBeActive Garmin Watch Face
![alt text](https://github.com/fevieira27/MoveToBeActive/blob/main/GitHub/Logo2-MoveToBeActive.png?raw=true)

Garmin Watch Face that was initially meant for the VivoActive 4 series, as I want to replace my current Vivomove HR soon. Even though I'm now going to move (no pun intended) to a more smartwatch kind of device instead of a hybrid, I do prefer the regular/classic look of an analog watch. So that's when I decided to start developing a watch face inspired by the design of the Vivomove series, but adding extra features that will be very useful for my daily type of usage (more health related than activity tracking).

I have tested/adapted this watch face to work with a few other rounded devices, including the new flagship Enduro (see picture below). I will be testing other watches soon an adding support on new releases.

## Feature listing:
* Analog hands for Hour and Minutes, but not for Seconds to mimic Vivomove HR (and save battery);
* Garmin Logo;
* Current Date;
* Battery percentage with symbol changing colors depending on battery left: Red (less than 10%), Yellow (between 11 and 20%) and Green (greater than 21%);
* Heart Rate data, showing last available value (not updated every second when not doing an activity, to save battery) and a symbol that is presented with colors from 7 different rate zones, set up by the user on the watch main settings (Settings - User Profile - Heart Rate - Zones - Based On);
* Notifications count;
* Floors climbed count;
* Distance travelled on the day (km or miles, dependent on watch's selected unit on general config);
* Temperature indicator (if available) in Celsius or Fahrenheit (also dependent on watch's selected units display);
* City name (if available) and current weather condition;
* Bluetooth indicator: Blue (connected to the phone) or Grey (not connected);
* Do not Disturb indicator (only shown if mode is active);
* Blood oxygen percentage, that when activated will temporarily replace the floor climb count. As soon as it deactivates, the floor climb count will show up again.
